/**
 * Minimal structural shape `useFieldValue` needs from a field.
 *
 * `store` is typed as `unknown` because:
 *   1. In this version of `@tanstack/react-form`, the store on a field is a
 *      `ReadonlyStore<FieldLikeState<...>>`. `ReadonlyStore` does not
 *      structurally expose `getState` in a way TypeScript can verify, so any
 *      concrete method-shape constraint fails the assignability check.
 *   2. `useFieldValue` never touches the store directly — it passes it to
 *      `useSelector`, which validates the store at the call boundary.
 *
 * Using `unknown` here defers all store-shape validation to `useSelector`,
 * where it belongs.
